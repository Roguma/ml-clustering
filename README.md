# Frontier-Based Exploration: Clustering Frontier Points

## Overview

In autonomous exploration, **frontier points** mark the boundary between known and unknown space in a robot's map.  
Selecting observation points (where the robot should move next) often involves **clustering** these frontiers into representative groups.

In this assignment, you will apply **off-the-shelf (OTS) clustering algorithms** to identify meaningful frontier clusters, and compare their performance to a provided **original clustering implementation**.

Keep in mind, the original clustering works directly with the native Robot Operating System (ROS) data formats, while the OTS solutions require numpy structured data. 
The conversion has been provided for local evaluation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

1. Implement and apply at least **two standard clustering algorithms** (*K-Means* and *Hierarchical Agglomerative*).
1. Compare and visualize the resulting clusters and observation points.
1. Discuss the trade-offs between custom and off-the-shelf clustering approaches.

## Setup

### 1. Clone and install
```
git clone <repo-url>
cd frontier-clustering
pip install -r requirements.txt   
```

Required packages:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn


### 2. Run baseline example

The provided code runs the original frontier clustering for comparison:

python main.py --method original

### 3. Implement your clustering

Edit clustering.py to complete the implementation for kmeans and heirarchical clustering.

Use scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans, AgglomerativeClustering
```

Run with your clustering method:

```bash
python main.py --method kmeans
python main.py --method hierarchical
```


## Tasks
1. Complete the imports and wiring in clustering.py
Implement at least two off-the-shelf clustering algorithms:
    * K-Means (sklearn.cluster.KMeans)
    * Hierarchical Agglomerative (sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering)
2. Run all three methods:
 * Your implementations (K-Means, Hierarchical)
 * The provided “original” clustering (frontiers/frontiers.py)
3. Visualize and compare:
 * Use utils/visualization.py to display the occupancy grid, frontier points, and resulting cluster centroids.
 * Observe how clusters differ in number, size, and placement.
4. Analyze:
Write a short summary (1–2 paragraphs):
 * Which clustering produced the most intuitive observation points?
 * How sensitive are the results to the choice of K or clustering parameters?
 * When might the custom clustering be preferable?


## Expected Output

After running each method, you should see plots similar to:
* Console output statistics and observation points.
* Occupancy grid showing free and occupied regions.
* Frontier grid highlighting unknown boundaries.
* Cluster visualization with colored frontier points and red “X” at cluster centroids.

Example console output:
```(base) karlanschneider@Mac ml-clustering % python main.py
